There are primarily two types of clocks. One being analog and the other being digital. The analog clock was the only type of clock in the past when there were no digital technology available. But with the dawn of digital era, digital clocks have become one of our daily necessities. We use digital clock in different forms like hand watch, cell phones, personal computers etc.

A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally, as opposed to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the “digital” description refers only to the display, not the drive mechanism.
To represent the time, most digital clocks use a seven-segment display. It shows hours, minutes and seconds and can be set to show in both 24 hours and 12 hours format.
